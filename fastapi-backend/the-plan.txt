# Pet Projects Showcase Website - Implementation Plan

## Architecture
- Frontend: React/TypeScript SPA on Vercel
- Backend: Node.js/Express API on Railway
- Database: PostgreSQL on Railway
- File Storage: Railway volumes or external service (Cloudinary)

## Step 1: Backend Setup (Railway)
1. Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up Express server with CORS for Vercel domain
3. Configure PostgreSQL database connection
4. Set up basic project structure:
   - /src/routes (auth, projects, admin, users)
   - /src/models (User, Project, Tag)
   - /src/middleware (auth, admin, validation)
   - /src/utils (database, validation, file upload)

## Step 2: Database Schema Design
1. Users table (id, email, username, password_hash, role, created_at)
2. Projects table (id, user_id, title, description, url, image_url, tags, monthly_visitors, status, created_at, approved_at)
3. Tags table (id, name, color)
4. Project_tags junction table
5. Monthly_stats table (project_id, month, visitor_count)

## Step 3: Backend API Endpoints
### Auth Routes
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/refresh
- GET /auth/me

### Public Routes
- GET /projects (with filtering, sorting, pagination)
- GET /projects/:id
- GET /tags

### User Routes (authenticated)
- POST /projects (submit new project)
- GET /my-projects
- PUT /projects/:id
- DELETE /projects/:id

### Admin Routes
- GET /admin/projects/pending
- PUT /admin/projects/:id/approve
- PUT /admin/projects/:id/reject
- GET /admin/users
- GET /admin/stats

## Step 4: Frontend Setup (Vercel)
1. Create React TypeScript app with Vite
2. Set up routing (React Router)
3. Configure environment variables for API URL
4. Set up basic project structure:
   - /src/components (common UI components)
   - /src/pages (Home, ProjectDetail, Submit, Login, Register, Admin)
   - /src/hooks (useAuth, useProjects, useApi)
   - /src/utils (api client, auth helpers)
   - /src/types (TypeScript interfaces)

## Step 5: Core Frontend Pages
1. Home page with project grid, filtering, sorting
2. Project detail page
3. User authentication (login/register)
4. Project submission form
5. User dashboard (my projects)
6. Admin panel (pending projects, user management)

## Step 6: Authentication Implementation
1. JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
2. Protected routes on frontend
3. Auth middleware on backend
4. Role-based access control (user/admin)

## Step 7: File Upload System
1. Configure multer for backend file handling
2. Set up Railway volumes or integrate Cloudinary
3. Image optimization and validation
4. Frontend drag-drop upload component

## Step 8: Admin Features
1. Project approval workflow
2. User management
3. Monthly visitor tracking
4. Prize announcement system

## Step 9: Advanced Features
1. Tag-based filtering system
2. Search functionality
3. Monthly leaderboard
4. Email notifications for approvals
5. Project analytics dashboard

## Step 10: Deployment & Production
1. Set up Railway production database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy backend to Railway
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
5. Set up domain and SSL

## Step 11: Monitoring & Maintenance
1. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
2. Database backups
3. Performance monitoring
4. User feedback system

## Technology Stack
