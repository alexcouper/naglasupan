# New Landing Page Design for Krí1.is

## Overview

A mission-focused landing page for the initial empty state launch where:
- No projects exist in the system yet
- No user base to showcase
- Focus on clear CTAs and mission-driven messaging
- Emphasize the monthly prize program as a key incentive

---

## Landing Page Structure

### Hero Section
- **Headline:** "Build for Iceland. Together."
- **Subheading:** Mission statement + monthly prize callout
  - "Connect with creators, showcase your side projects, and compete for monthly recognition and prizes."
- **CTA Buttons:**
  - Primary: "Submit Your Project"
  - Secondary: "View Monthly Prize"

---

## Mission Section
- **Title:** "Why Krí1.is?"
- **Content:** 3-4 key problems being solved
  - Creators working in isolation
  - No central place for Icelandic innovation
  - Missing opportunities for collaboration
  - Untapped potential in the community
- **Value:** How the platform helps

---

## What You Get Section (Core Value Props)
- **Title:** "Build. Showcase. Win."
- **Three Value Props:**

  1. **Visibility for Your Projects**
     - "Get featured in our community and compete for monthly prizes"

  2. **Connect with Fellow Builders**
     - "Find collaborators and learn from Iceland's tech community"

  3. **Contribute to Iceland's Growth**
     - "Projects that strengthen our society"

- **Callout:** "Monthly Prize Highlights" section emphasizing the prize angle

---

## How It Works
- **Title:** "The Journey"
- **Flow:** Submit your project → Community sees it → Compete for monthly prize → Recognition
- **Visual:** Clear, simple step-by-step flow showing the prize angle

---

## Featured/Highlighted Section
- **Title:** "This Month's Prize"
- **Content:**
  - Show placeholder for when first projects arrive
  - Message: "When projects arrive, the community votes and creators win recognition + prizes"
- **Visual:** Mock "Featured Project of the Month" card (with placeholder image/content)

---

## Key Messaging Themes

### Instead of Generic Messaging:
❌ "Come build together and connect"
✅ "Come build, get recognized, and win prizes"

### Emphasis Areas:
1. **Recognition** - Projects get highlighted monthly
2. **Competition** - Feel of achievement and winning
3. **Prizes** - Tangible rewards for participation
4. **Mission** - Strengthening Iceland's society

---

## Visual Elements & Design Notes

- **Badge/Trophy Icon** - Next to "Monthly Prize" sections
- **Featured Project Card** - Placeholder design for "Project of the Month"
- **Prize Value Callout** - Display prize info (e.g., "Win recognition, featured placement, and prizes")
- **Color/Energy** - Use vibrant, motivational design that conveys opportunity and community
- **Illustrations** - Focus on collaboration, community (not individual user avatars)

---

## CTAs Throughout Page

1. **Hero CTA:** "Submit Your Project" + "View Monthly Prize"
2. **What You Get Section:** Prominent "Submit Now" button
3. **How It Works Section:** "Ready to compete? Submit your project"
4. **Featured Section:** "Be featured next month"
5. **Footer CTA:** "Ready to be featured? Submit your project and compete for this month's prize."

---

## Design Principles

- **No Vanity Metrics** - Zero user counts, testimonials, or social proof on empty state
- **Aspirational Tone** - Focus on potential and impact, not current popularity
- **Action-Oriented** - Multiple, clear pathways to join (submit project, view prizes, etc.)
- **Mission Visibility** - "Strengthen Iceland" angle present throughout
- **Prize-Forward** - Monthly prize program is a key differentiator and emphasized

---

## Additional Sections to Consider

### "How It Works" Detail
- Simple 3-step flow: Submit → Share → Impact
- OR 4-step with prizes: Submit → Showcase → Compete → Win

### "What Gets Built Here"
- Categories of projects welcome (fintech, education, infrastructure, etc.)

### "Coming Soon"
- Tease Phase 2 features (company profiles, knowledge base, etc.) to create anticipation

### FAQ
- Address common questions about submission, approval, privacy, etc.

---

## Tone & Voice

Replace generic messaging with mission-driven, competitive tone:
- ❌ "Join thousands of creators"
- ✅ "Be part of Iceland's innovation movement"
- ✅ "Your side project could strengthen Iceland"
- ✅ "The platform for Iceland's builders"
- ✅ "Where Icelandic ideas become reality"
- ✅ "Build. Compete. Make an impact."

## Next Steps

1. Design mockups based on this structure
2. Implement the landing page component in Next.js
3. Create the monthly prize showcase section
4. Add placeholder content and CTAs
5. Test conversion paths and user engagement
