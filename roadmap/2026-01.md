## Jan

- [x] Delete a project
- [x] Edit a project
- [x] Images on projects
- [x] Get logs working properly - not seeing where things are redirected to
- [x] Set up email (so can send out notices to users)
- [x] Remove old ecr containers
- [x] Project listing page

NEEDED:
Project prize announcement page

Separation of dev and prod environment: bucket for dev for local usage.
Better IAM - eg should be able to run migrations without needing to setup stuff. I should always be ME rather than using the app
Categorization of projects: Tech & stack tags, industry, project status (side hustle, full time) and funding (bootstrapped, ...)
